# Challenge-5
# Financial Planning with APIs and Simulations

This challenge's objective is to create two financial analysis tools by using a single Jupyter notebook:

# A financial planner for emergencies. The members will be able to use this tool to visualize their current savings. The members can then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.

# A financial planner for retirement. This tool will forecast the performance of their retirement portfolio in 30 years. To do this, the tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.

The steps include:

Evaluate the Cryptocurrency Wallet by Using the Requests Library

Evaluate the Stock and Bond Holdings by Using the Alpaca SDK

Evaluate the Emergency Fund

Create a Financial Planner for Retirement

Analyze the Retirement Portfolio Forecasts

Forecast Cumulative Returns in 10 Years
